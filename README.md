# wakeUpApp
App I'm developing for commuters. The idea is an application which lets a user enter in a desired location and set a specific kilometre radius. Upon the user entering the radius of the application sets off an alert, or alarm. The idea being that a commuter on a long train, bus or tram journey would not have to worry about missing their stop after falling asleep. 

**IN PROGRESS**
